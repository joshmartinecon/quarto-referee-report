# Brief Note to the Author(s)

I view this report as being much more of a beginning of a conversation between us and the editor rather than me listing a series of hoops that you must jump through for publication. I welcome scholarly disagreement to any of the comments that I have left about your paper below. For the purposes of grammatical simplicity, I will assume that there is one author.

# Summary

The paper asks both an interesting and very timely question that could appeal to a broad audience of...

# Primary Concerns

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Here is one primary concern.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Here is a sub-point to this primary concern.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Example 1: Here is a brief commentary about this concern. "\textit{Here is sample text from the paper that represents my concern.}"
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Here is a second sub-point to this primary concern.
\end{enumerate}
    
# Secondary Concerns

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Inserting pictures is easy too!

  \item Writing equations is the same as if you were doing it in LaTex.
  
  \begin{equation}
    y_{it} = \cbox{\alpha_i} + \delta_t + \beta_1 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
    \tag{Equation 4}
  \end{equation}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Above I have highlighted a unit fixed effect.
  \end{itemize}
